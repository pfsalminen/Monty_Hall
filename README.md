# Monty Hall Problem Simulation
Program to test the Monty Hall Problem
The program runs over 1000000 simulations of the monty hall program.
It then outputs the percentage of times the first guess was correct, and the number of times the second guess was correct. 

## Results
Since the program generates random numbers, the actual results vary each time

## Sample Results:
First Guess: 33.22% 
Second Guess: 66.78%
